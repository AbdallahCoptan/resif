    RESIF: Revolutionary EasyBuild-based Software Installation Framework
    ~~~~~~~

RESIF is a wrapper on top of Easybuild designed to easily setup, build a set of
software (defined through software sets) and deploy them either locally or
within a High Performance Computing (HPC) facility.

Developed by the Sysadmins Team managing the HPC facility of the University of
Luxembourg, RESIF is based on [Easybuild](https://hpcugent.github.io/easybuild) and
[LMod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod).
RESIF also permits to rebuild a previously deployed software configuration in
the attempt to facilitate Reproducible Research.
